### Step 6: Commit Templates

```bash
git add .github/
git commit -m "feat: add issue templates for bug reports, features, and questions"
git push origin main
```

## Part 3: Create Label Taxonomy (15 minutes)

### Step 7: Design Label System

Create a comprehensive label system. Create `.github/labels.yml`:

```yaml
# Type Labels
- name: "bug"
  color: "d73a4a"
  description: "Something isn't working"

- name: "enhancement"
  color: "a2eeef"
  description: "New feature or request"

- name: "documentation"
  color: "0075ca"
  description: "Improvements or additions to documentation"

- name: "question"
  color: "d876e3"
  description: "Further information is requested"

# Priority Labels
- name: "priority: critical"
  color: "b60205"
  description: "Critical priority - immediate attention required"

- name: "priority: high"
  color: "d93f0b"
  description: "High priority - should be addressed soon"

- name: "priority: medium"
  color: "fbca04"
  description: "Medium priority - normal queue"

- name: "priority: low"
  color: "0e8a16"
  description: "Low priority - nice to have"

# Status Labels
- name: "needs-triage"
  color: "ededed"
  description: "Needs initial review and categorization"

- name: "in-progress"
  color: "c5def5"
  description: "Currently being worked on"

- name: "wontfix"
  color: "ffffff"
  description: "This will not be worked on"

- name: "duplicate"
  color: "cfd3d7"
  description: "This issue or pull request already exists"

# Area Labels
- name: "area: frontend"
  color: "5319e7"
  description: "Frontend-related issues"

- name: "area: backend"
  color: "5319e7"
  description: "Backend-related issues"

- name: "area: database"
  color: "5319e7"

```

### Step 8: Apply Labels Using Script

Create `scripts/apply-labels.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Apply labels to repository
# Usage: ./scripts/apply-labels.sh

REPO="your-username/gitpolish-lab-2.1"

# Read labels from YAML and create them
# Note: This requires 'yq' tool or manual creation via GitHub UI

echo "Labels should be created via GitHub UI or using gh CLI"
echo "Visit: https://github.com/$REPO/labels"
```

Alternatively, create labels manually through the GitHub web interface at:
`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/gitpolish-lab-2.1/labels`

## Part 4: Practice Issue Triage (20 minutes)

### Step 9: Create Sample Issues

Create 5 sample issues to practice triaging:

1. **Bug: Login button not responding**
   - Type: Bug
   - Priority: High
   - Area: Frontend

2. **Feature: Add dark mode support**
   - Type: Enhancement
   - Priority: Medium
   - Area: Frontend

3. **Question: How to configure database connection?**
   - Type: Question
   - Area: Database

4. **Bug: API returns 500 error on user creation**
   - Type: Bug
   - Priority: Critical
   - Area: API, Backend

5. **Enhancement: Improve documentation for deployment**
   - Type: Documentation
   - Priority: Low

### Step 10: Triage Process

For each issue, practice the following triage process:

1. **Read and understand** the issue
2. **Verify completeness** - Does it have all necessary information?
3. **Categorize** - Apply appropriate type, priority, and area labels
4. **Estimate effort** - Apply effort label
5. **Assign or comment** - Assign to a team member or request more information
6. **Link related issues** - Cross-reference related issues if applicable

Document your triage decisions in a file called `triage-notes.md`.

## Part 5: Issue Management Best Practices (15 minutes)

### Step 11: Create Issue Management Guidelines

Create `.github/ISSUE_MANAGEMENT.md`:

```markdown
# Issue Management Guidelines

## For Issue Reporters

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the appropriate template** (bug, feature, question)
3. **Provide complete information** - incomplete issues will be labeled "needs-info"
4. **Be specific and clear** - vague issues are hard to address

### Writing Good Issue Titles

- ‚úÖ Good: "[BUG] Login button unresponsive on mobile Safari"
- ‚ùå Bad: "Button doesn't work"

- ‚úÖ Good: "[FEATURE] Add export to CSV functionality for reports"
- ‚ùå Bad: "Export feature"

## For Issue Triagers

### Triage Process

1. **Review new issues** daily
2. **Remove "needs-triage" label** after initial review
3. **Add appropriate labels** (type, priority, area, effort)
4. **Assign to team member** or milestone if applicable
5. **Request clarification** if information is missing
6. **Close duplicates** with reference to original issue

### Priority Guidelines

- **Critical:** System down, data loss, security vulnerability
- **High:** Major feature broken, significant user impact
- **Medium:** Minor feature broken, workaround available
- **Low:** Nice-to-have, minor improvement

### Response Time Targets

- Critical: Within 1 hour
- High: Within 1 day
- Medium: Within 3 days
- Low: Within 1 week

## For Developers

### Working on Issues

1. **Comment on the issue** before starting work
2. **Update status labels** (in-progress, blocked, ready-for-review)
3. **Reference the issue** in commit messages and PRs
4. **Update the issue** with progress notes
5. **Close the issue** when work is merged (use "Closes #123" in PR)

### Linking Issues to PRs

Use keywords in PR descriptions:
- `Closes #123` - Closes the issue when PR is merged
- `Fixes #123` - Same as Closes
- `Resolves #123` - Same as Closes
- `Relates to #123` - Links without closing

## Automation

### Auto-labeling

Issues created from templates are automatically labeled:
- Bug reports ‚Üí "bug", "needs-triage"
- Feature requests ‚Üí "enhancement", "needs-triage"
- Questions ‚Üí "question"

### Stale Issue Management

Issues with no activity for 60 days will be:
1. Labeled "stale"
2. Commented with warning
3. Closed after 7 more days if no response

## Metrics

Track these metrics monthly:
- Time to first response
- Time to resolution
- Number of issues opened/closed
- Issue backlog size
```

## Part 6: Reflection and Documentation (10 minutes)

### Step 12: Document Your System

Create `LAB-2.1-REPORT.md` documenting:

1. **System Overview**
   - What templates did you create?
   - What labels did you implement?
   - What guidelines did you establish?

2. **Triage Practice**
   - How did you triage each of the 5 sample issues?
   - What labels did you apply and why?
   - What challenges did you encounter?

3. **Best Practices Learned**
   - What are the key elements of effective issue management?
   - How does this system improve collaboration?
   - What would you do differently in a real project?

4. **GitPolish Protocol‚Ñ¢ Application**
   - How does this lab demonstrate Documentation Excellence?
   - How does automation improve quality assurance?
   - How does this system support knowledge transfer?

## Deliverables
