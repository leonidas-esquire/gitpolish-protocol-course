### Scenario 18: Forking a Repository for Experimentation
Use forking strategies to experiment safely without affecting production code.

### Scenario 19: Generating Automated Documentation
Implement tools and workflows for automatic documentation generation from code.

### Scenario 20: Implementing Branching Strategies
Choose and implement appropriate branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow) for your team.

## Labs and Exercises

### Lab 2.1: Issue Management System Setup
Create a comprehensive issue management system with templates, labels, and automation.

**Objectives:**
- Create issue templates for bugs, features, and questions
- Set up label taxonomy
- Configure issue automation
- Practice triaging and prioritizing issues

### Lab 2.2: Code Review Workshop
Practice conducting professional code reviews on sample pull requests.

**Objectives:**
- Review code for quality, security, and maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback
- Use GitHub's review features effectively
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency

### Lab 2.3: GitHub Projects Board
Set up a project board for sprint planning and tracking.

**Objectives:**
- Create project board with appropriate columns
- Add and organize issues
- Track progress through a sprint
- Generate reports and insights

## Key Concepts

### Documentation Excellence Pillar
- **Issue Documentation**: Every task, bug, and feature should be documented in an issue
- **Code Review Documentation**: Reviews should be thorough, constructive, and documented
- **Process Documentation**: Workflows and procedures should be clearly documented
- **Decision Documentation**: Important decisions should be recorded and explained

### Collaboration Best Practices
- **Clear Communication**: Use templates and standards for consistent communication
- **Transparency**: Make work visible through issues, projects, and pull requests
- **Feedback Culture**: Foster constructive, respectful code review practices
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document processes so knowledge isn't siloed

### Security Through Process
- **Access Control**: Limit permissions to what's necessary
- **Code Review**: Multiple eyes on code catch security issues
- **Automation**: Automated security scanning catches vulnerabilities early
- **Documentation**: Security practices should be documented and followed

## Assessment

### Knowledge Check Quiz
A 10-question quiz covering key concepts from Scenarios 11-20.

### Practical Exercise
Set up a complete collaboration workflow for a sample project including:
- Issue templates
- Code review process
- Project board
- Branching strategy
