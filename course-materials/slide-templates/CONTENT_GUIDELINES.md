# GitPolish Protocol‚Ñ¢ Slide Content Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for creating effective, professional slide content for Modules 2-6 of the GitPolish Protocol‚Ñ¢ Certification Course.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Information Density**
Balance substance with clarity. Each slide should deliver meaningful content without overwhelming the audience.

**Guidelines:**
- **3-5 key points maximum** per slide
- **One central idea** per slide
- **30-50 words** for bullet points
- **Avoid walls of text** - use visuals when possible

### 2. **Professional Tone**
Maintain authority while remaining accessible.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Authoritative**: Demonstrate expertise
- **Practical**: Focus on actionable insights
- **Clear**: Avoid jargon unless necessary
- **Engaging**: Use active voice and direct language

### 3. **GitPolish Protocol‚Ñ¢ Alignment**
Every slide should connect to the five pillars.

**The Five Pillars:**
1. **Architecture**: Repository structure and organization
2. **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive communication
3. **Workflow**: Efficient processes and automation
4. **Quality Control**: Standards and review processes
5. **Security & Compliance**: Protection and best practices

## Slide Types & Best Practices

### Title Slides
**Purpose**: Set expectations and create visual impact

**Elements:**
- Module number and title
- Compelling subtitle
- Course branding
- Scenarios covered
- Duration estimate

**Example:**
```
MODULE 02
Advanced GitHub Features & Collaboration
Master the command center of professional repository management

GitPolish Protocol‚Ñ¢ Certification Course
Scenarios 11-20 | 20 Slides | 2.5 Hours
```

### Overview Slides
**Purpose**: Orient learners and establish learning objectives

**Elements:**
- 5-7 clear learning objectives
- Module structure overview
- Expected outcomes
- Connection to previous/next modules

**Writing Tips:**
- Use action verbs (Master, Implement, Configure, Apply)
- Be specific about skills gained
- Highlight practical applications

### Scenario Slides
**Purpose**: Present real-world situations and solutions

**Structure:**
1. **Scenario title** (insight-driven, not topic label)
2. **Context**: Why this matters
3. **Key points**: 3-5 main takeaways
4. **GitPolish connection**: Which pillars apply
5. **Practical application**: How to use this

**Example Structure:**
```
Title: "GitHub Issues: The Central Nervous System of Your Project"

Context:
Issues aren't just bug reports - they're project intelligence that drives decision-making and coordination.

Key Points:
‚ñ∏ Issue templates standardize communication
‚ñ∏ Labels create categorization systems
‚ñ∏ Milestones enable release planning
‚ñ∏ Project boards visualize workflow
‚ñ∏ Automation reduces manual overhead

GitPolish Pillars: Architecture, Documentation, Workflow
```

### Deep Dive Slides
**Purpose**: Provide detailed technical information

**Elements:**
- Clear section headings
- Step-by-step processes
- Code examples (when relevant)
- Visual aids (screenshots, diagrams)
- Best practices callouts

**Content Density:**
- More detailed than scenario slides
- Still maintain 3-5 main sections
- Use sub-bullets sparingly

### Lab Preview Slides
**Purpose**: Prepare learners for hands-on exercises

**Required Elements:**
- Lab number and title
- Clear objectives (3-5 specific goals)
- Estimated time
- Expected deliverable
- Prerequisites (if any)

**Format:**
```
Lab 2.1: Issue Management System Setup

Objectives:
‚ñ∏ Create custom issue templates
‚ñ∏ Design label taxonomy
‚ñ∏ Configure milestone structure
‚ñ∏ Set up project board automation
‚ñ∏ Link issues to pull requests

Time: 45 minutes
Deliverable: Fully configured issue management system
```

### Knowledge Check Slides
**Purpose**: Assess understanding and reinforce learning

**Question Types:**
- **Recall**: What are the five...?
- **Application**: When should you...?
- **Analysis**: What's the difference between...?
- **Synthesis**: How would you combine...?

**Guidelines:**
- 6-8 questions per module
- Mix question types
- Reference specific scenarios
- Provide time estimate (10 minutes)

### Completion Slides
**Purpose**: Summarize and transition to next module

**Elements:**
- Key takeaways (5-7 main points)
- Module achievements
- Next module preview
- Resources for further learning

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Headlines
**DO:**
- Write as insights or conclusions
- Use active, compelling language
- Make them specific and actionable

**Example:**
‚úÖ "Code Review: Where Quality Is Enforced, Not Hoped For"
‚ùå "Code Review Process"

**DON'T:**
- Use generic topic labels
- Be vague or abstract
- Rely on buzzwords

### Bullet Points
**DO:**
- Start with strong action verbs
- Keep parallel structure
- Be concise but complete
- Use sub-bullets sparingly (max 2 levels)

**Example:**
```
‚úÖ Good:
‚ñ∏ Configure branch protection to prevent accidental deletions
‚ñ∏ Require pull request reviews before merging
‚ñ∏ Enable status checks to gate deployments

‚ùå Bad:
‚ñ∏ Branch protection
‚ñ∏ Reviews
‚ñ∏ Status checks
```

**DON'T:**
- Write complete sentences as bullets
- Mix different grammatical structures
- Overuse sub-bullets

### Technical Content
**DO:**
- Use code blocks for commands
- Provide context for technical terms
- Include practical examples
- Reference official documentation

**Example:**
```
Permission Levels:
‚ñ∏ Read: View and clone repositories
‚ñ∏ Triage: Manage issues without code access
‚ñ∏ Write: Push to non-protected branches
‚ñ∏ Maintain: Manage repository settings
‚ñ∏ Admin: Full control including deletion
```

**DON'T:**
- Assume prior knowledge
- Use jargon without explanation
- Provide commands without context

## Visual Strategy

### When to Use Images
**Use images for:**
- Complex workflows (diagrams)
- UI demonstrations (screenshots)
- Comparisons (side-by-side)
- Inspiration (title slides)

**Avoid images for:**
- Simple concepts (use text)
- Decoration only (no purpose)
- Low-quality or watermarked content

### Image Guidelines
- **High resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080 for full-slide
- **Relevant**: Directly supports content
- **Professional**: Clean, clear, well-composed
- **Accessible**: Include alt text descriptions

### Code Examples
**Format:**
```
git checkout -b feature/new-functionality
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new functionality"
git push origin feature/new-functionality
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use monospace font (Fira Code)
- Syntax highlighting when possible
- Keep examples short (5-10 lines max)
- Include comments for clarity

## Engagement Techniques

### Questions to Audience
Pose rhetorical questions to stimulate thinking:
- "What happens when your team has no code review process?"
- "How do you know which issues are critical?"
- "When was the last time you audited repository permissions?"

### "Think About" Prompts
Encourage reflection:
- "Think about: How many repositories in your organization lack proper documentation?"
- "Consider: What would happen if your main branch had no protection?"

### Real-World Connections
Reference common scenarios:
- "In a recent survey, 73% of developers reported..."
- "Consider a client project where..."
- "Many teams struggle with..."
